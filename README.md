Top right bar: the bell is the notification but it is not very explicit that the box is the number of outdated brew packages.
Maybe you could make it a bit clearer by adding an infotooltip when the user hovers mouse over the icon?

When all the packages are up to date the box turns green and there is a tick on the right next to it.

This, along with the Github Notification Bell makes it extremely easy to stay on top of things as you develop your project.
